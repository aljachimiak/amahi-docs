# Requirements

These are the hardware requirements to install your Amahi Server. The closer you follow them, the better off you will be to ensure a smooth deployment.

1. Hardware: A computer with minimum required specs of
	* 1GHz CPU
	* 4GB Disk, and
	* 512MB RAM
	* ... The more the better, of course!

1. Software: Ubuntu 12.04 bootable CD or DVD (Desktop or server, 32 bits or 64 bits)

	* Obtain it from the download mirrors or from the torrents
	* There are other options, such as Kubuntu, Edubuntu, USB etc., however, these are strongly discouraged, unless you are a Linux expert and have no other choice

1. An internet connection to the computer during install

	Only the first ethernet card eth0 is supported out of the box. You may want to read this brief overview on the Amahi install process
